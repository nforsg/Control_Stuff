    "$$\\Delta = -\\dot{\\psi}_d vcos(\\psi-\\psi_d), \\;\\; |\\Delta| \\le \\Delta_{max} < \\infty$$\n",
    "Now at the outer loop, we from now on use the notation $a_m^c$ and use sliding mode control based on $(1)$ to drive the state $x = (d, \\dot{d})$ towards the sliding surface \n",
    "$$S_d = d + \\frac{1}{\\beta_d} \\dot{d}^{\\frac{p_d}{q_d}},$$\n",
